# == Class: patchwork::uwsgi
#
# Manages the configuration of uwsgi
#
# === Variables
#
# Here you should define a list of variables that this module would require.
#
# * `sample variable`
#  Explanation of how this variable affects the function of this class and if
#  it has a default. e.g. "The parameter enc_ntp_servers must be set by the
#  External Node Classifier as a comma separated list of hostnames." (Note,
#  global variables should be avoided in favor of class parameters as
#  of Puppet 2.6.)
